# Animation of Kevlar's Chemical Structure
This repo holds the code for my [web animation](https://www.param.me/kevlar/) of kevlar's chemical structure. The animation was created in [After Effects CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html), exported to JSON using the [Bodymovin plugin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/), and rendered with [Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/). If you'd like to create your own web animation, I recommend checking out this [helpful article](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/export-after-effects-animations-to-html5).
